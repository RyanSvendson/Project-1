## Title: 

College Savings Planner

## User Story: 

Our clients are a family of 3 with one child age 5. They are wanting to know if they are saving enough into the childâ€™s 529 plan to cover the cost of college if they started today with an initial deposit of $3,000 and $500 per month until the child enters college.  


## User Question: 

Has the family saved enough for college? 

## API: 

Collegeai.com - for college data
NASDAQ - for portfolio data
 
## CLI

asking questions to determine actions of application

## Analysis

529 portfolio -> different risk 
Monte carlo for portfolio(s)
Initial deposit into 529 & recurring deposit into account
Multiple line chart showing savings vs specific college

## Analysis:
